<strong>"What's the difference between NITK and XYZ college?"</strong> This is the question which is frequently asked to me either by friends,family or a complete stranger.While some ask out of curiosity,others to ignite a argument that all colleges/universities are same and the "XYZ college" is just like NITK; perhaps maybe..

<strong>"Which college are you in? NITK? Where is it? Manglore? Oh ok"</strong> - This is another frequent reaction from a set of people.

So I felt this was a unique topic to begin a blog with.

I present you my first post of this blog, "Namma NITK-as seen by a home-state fresher "

India is a country where you are judged by your qualification rather than skills.Quoting <strong>Farhan aka Madhavan </strong> from <strong>3 idiots :</strong>
<blockquote><em><strong>"Degree nahi,toh na koi company naukari degi,naa koi baap apna beti,na koi bank credit card degi,naa duniya respect..."</strong></em></blockquote>
Without a degree,no company would give a job,no father would give a bride,no bank a credit card and world won't give respect.

Thus in India we see a ratrace from early childhood to get <strong>well settled</strong> in life,where no one really understands and defines correctly the meaning of "well settled".Its not a 'well-defined' word.Parents who could barely achieve their goals,impose them on their children and this is how <strong>Doctors and Engineers</strong> are born in India rather than <strong>girls and boys. </strong>

Most of the students first try to chase a medical seat and if they fail, a engineering seat and if they fail this time then they'll check the other options.

The dream college of all engineering aspirants inside India are <strong>"The IITs"</strong> - (no abbreviation required) for which one has to work the ass up to be one among barely 10,000 aspirants out of 3 lakh other aspirants.And the major twist is the loophole called Reservation.

And the remaining(the major portion) enter NITs,IIITs and then the state engineering colleges.

And the author is one among those remaining ,who joined NITK.

NITK Surathkal ,National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal,one among the colleges of national importance is like a pearl in the coastline of Dakshina Kannada district of sandal state Karnataka .It is ranked 22nd in the survey conducted by Ministry of HRD in the academic year 2015-16.Also it has been ranked <strong><em>8th in India Today India's best Engineering colleges 2016,</em>being the first NIT in the list.</strong>

Its the <strong>only NIT</strong> to represent its state in the name itself, <strong>K for Karnataka</strong>.And that is because it was formerly called <strong>KREC,Karnataka regional engineering college</strong> and it was in 2003, it was renamed as NITK with Karnataka as a suffix to respect the sentiments of the locals.

<strong>THE NITK BEACH</strong>: The most inseparable part of NITK is its private beach.Perhaps the only college to own a private beach.The reason why most of the students choose NITK.The beach is decently clean, has a serene climate conditions and yes... a lighthouse.

You are not a true NITKian if you haven't taken a selfie with the lighthouse or on the lighthouse.

There are many cool events conducted on the beach during fests right from kite flying,motor boating to DJ nights.Neednot to mention its the favourite spot of the young couples..

<strong>HOSTEL BLOCKS:</strong> Trust me,you are never gonna be bored in hostels and that too when its NITK. Watching shows and sports in TV room,birthday parties,Mini militia and other multiplayer games-which brings together students from all the states and communities,the fluctuating LAN speeds,the mess-which is neither bad nor good,the life saving night canteens and the security who cares like his own children(there are exceptions) ...You are really missing a lot of fun if you don't stay at hostel and when its NITK hostels, you are at a loss.

<strong>THE CAMPUS:</strong> NITK has well established <strong>250 acre campus</strong> with appreciably good infrastructure and well distributed coffee shops and canteens. A magnificent library,CCC-Central computing centre,standard sports ground,Indoor stadium,SAC-Student activity centre,SJA-Silver jubilee hall,well maintained swimming pool,basketball-volleyball-tennis courts and yea...The NITK GYMnasium are the attractions of NITK. They have kept Girls' block (GB) infront of Mechanical Department or vice-versa maybe just to boost mech students attendance xD

<strong>SAC</strong>- Student activity center

<strong>THE STUDENTS:</strong> The heart of NITK is its students from varied cultures across the world.There are students not only from different states of INDIA,but also from other nationalities.There is <strong>DASA</strong>(Direct Admissions of Students Abroad) scheme through which abroad students get a chance to study in Indian universities after getting through the necessary entrance tests.(Generally kids of insanely rich NRIs XD).The advantage of learning in a college of national importance is that the person is exposed to various cultures and languages across the world and this helps one to develop a good personality with non-biased nature.No doubt sometimes people make groups on basis of language and states like the typical Indian mentality but as a technical team of engineers, there is a sense of oneness.

<strong>THE FESTS:</strong> There are two major fests:
<strong>ENGINEER</strong>-technical fest conducted during odd semester.Affectionately called <strong>ENGI©*</strong>
<a href="http://wittynerd.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/wp-1466499302895.png"><img class="alignnone size-full" title="wp-1466499302895" src="http://wittynerd.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/wp-1466499302895.png" alt="image" /></a>ENGI logo

<strong>INCIDENT</strong>-cultural/non-technical fest conducted during even semesters. Affectionately called <strong>INCI™*</strong>
<a href="http://wittynerd.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/wp-1466499356295.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" title="wp-1466499356295" src="http://wittynerd.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/wp-1466499356295.jpg" alt="image" /></a>INCI logo

<strong>* -> Lol:p No copyright/trademark. Just attention grabber</strong>.

Fests are conducted with great zeal and enthusiasm just like every other college but care is taken to bring in good number of sponsers (This is where you learn <strong>Marketing</strong> -a far relative of engineering) and to involve all the freshers and getting work done from them by convincing them they can boast of their contribution as "additional element" in their resumes (Technical ragging XD).Though the quality of fests has been just satisfactory in the past years,there is a hope for better ones with the new student council.

<a href="http://wittynerd.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/wp-1466499382995.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" title="wp-1466499382995" src="http://wittynerd.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/wp-1466499382995.jpg" alt="image" /></a>College during fests

<strong>THE SCOPE:</strong> Being a college of national importance,NITK provides sufficient opportunities to the budding engineers through lots of programmes and workshops.There are many tech clubs like <strong>IEEE,ISTE,IRIS,WEB club</strong> etc. also Non-technical clubs like <strong>MEDIA,FILM,LITERATURE,ARTISTS' FORUM,ROTARY</strong> etc. Students interested in building startups are also thoroughly encouraged and supported by giving the right direction.The backbone of NITK is its <strong>Alumni association,</strong>a network of alumni of NITK who actively participate in overall development of NITKians.

<a>
</a>

Overall,one can conclude that NITK is a good place for learning and has a conductive environment.With increasing number of graduate colleges year by year,the college from where one graduated has become immaterial..What matters for the world is the talent and the ability to complete the assigned task skillfully and to certain extent of perfection.<strong>And thus IITs,NITs have become just brandnames..</strong>

 

At the end all that matters isn't <strong>"from where one got the degree"</strong>, what matters is <strong>"how the degree was utilized and applied for the progress".
